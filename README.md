# Pizza Co. 🍕

A sleek React + Redux + React Router pizza ordering app with live cart functionality, checkout, and order search features.

---

## 🎯 Overview

Pizza Co. lets users browse pizzas fetched from an API, see availability status (sold out or price shown), add or remove items to their cart with live total updates in the header, and manage orders in a dedicated cart page.
A checkout flow collects user name (pre-filled), phone number, address, and Prime delivery option. After placing the order, users see a summary with order number and estimated waiting time. Find past orders using the search box in the header.
